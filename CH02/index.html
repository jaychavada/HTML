        Boredom Prompt

        1. Do something boring. It could be sitting in front of a window, watching a TV show that is boring, listening to a podcast that's not that engaging, but don't multitaskâ€”do just the one thing, and do it for as much time as you have (fifteen minutes if that's all you have, or thirty if you've got longer).
     
        2. While you're doing whatever boring thing you're doing, have a timer go off every three minutes, and when it goes off, write down three words. 
     
        3. Now, use the words you wrote down to begin your poem. What do they have in common? What's the thread you're finding? Or string them all together for your first line.
